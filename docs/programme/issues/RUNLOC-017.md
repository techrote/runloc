# RUNLOC-017 — Qualify a Linux/KVM host backend with the same lease contract

Stage: **follow-on**. Planning status: **planned**. This issue is not implemented by publication of the programme.

## Dependencies and prerequisites

Depends on: [RUNLOC-014](https://github.com/techrote/runloc/issues/14)

None beyond accepted dependencies and ordinary local development tools.

Confirm dependency PRs are accepted on current main before coding. Follow-on issues do not block v0.1.

## Autonomous execution prompt

Implement **RUNLOC-017** end to end in `techrote/runloc`. Fetch current main; read this complete live issue and every comment, dependency result, overlapping PR and the linked instructions below. Use an isolated `runloc-017-short-name` branch. The owner authorizes the ordinary implementation, tests, PR and merge cycle under these contracts; routine confirmation is unnecessary. Do not start a later issue or deploy unrelated infrastructure.

The scope, observable acceptance and tests below are binding. Inspect existing code first and preserve already accepted work. Add meaningful retained regressions and exact-source checks; use synthetic credentials and temporary assets. Update affected RAG contracts with implementation. Review and improve the change before opening the PR; record the actual reviewer/author roles without claiming independence from self-review.

## Scope to deliver

- Implement optional Linux x64/KVM doctor/process/locking/permission adapters while preserving the shared CLI/lease/evidence interfaces.
- Use a native owned process/session relationship, QMP and explicit KVM with the accepted Linux guest profile.
- Add platform-specific qualification and documentation without replacing Windows/WHPX coverage.

## Observable acceptance criteria

- KVM permission or capability failure is explicit, with no privilege install or implicit TCG fallback.
- Owned process identity/death/recovery and single-job disposal match existing invariants under native Linux tests.
- Actual Linux/KVM job/cleanup receipts prove support; Ubuntu hosted unit CI alone does not.
- Windows required tests remain green and Linux-specific paths do not regress Windows path/ACL behavior.
- One platform cannot satisfy a missing qualification gate for another.

## Required implementation/testing work

- Native Linux process-group/start-time/signal and lock tests, reused PID and unrelated sentinel controls.
- Real bounded KVM Linux job and failure cleanup on approved hardware, recorded separately from WHPX.
- Shared conformance suite and CLI schema parity across both hosts.

Also run `python scripts/check_repository.py` and `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"`. From RUNLOC-001 onward run the consolidated `python scripts/check.py` and the issue's focused tests. All commands must target the intended checkout. Normal PR checks must require no VM/API credentials; separate physical/live acceptance is required only where specified and cannot be replaced by a mocked or all-skipped pass.

## Excluded scope

No rootless-container replacement, host service, GPU device passthrough or automatic device-permission changes.

## PR, automated checks and autonomous merge

Commit only clean intended source/tests/docs. Push a PR containing `Closes #<this issue number>`, a concise behavior summary, actual test/evidence links, limitations and RAG updates. Do not close this issue through a partial implementation. Inspect final diff and resolve material review findings. Wait for **all actual required automated checks on the exact PR head**, with about 120-second polling intervals. Fix relevant failures; do not disable checks or merge known-red work.

When dependencies and every acceptance clause are satisfied, required checks are green, review threads are resolved and no owner hold exists, squash-merge using the exact expected head. Do not use admin overrides or weaken branch protection. Verify the resulting main and post-merge checks, then add a factual completion comment with source/evidence and update programme status. If post-merge acceptance fails, reopen the issue and repair it.

If permissions, required review, approved hardware, credentials or another binding prerequisite is unavailable, preserve a reviewable draft PR and exact blocker. Never enroll credentials, change host privileges, fake physical acceptance or declare a merge that did not happen. A documented no-go completes a research issue only when its acceptance criteria explicitly allow it.
